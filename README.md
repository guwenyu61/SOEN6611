Up to date, many metric suits have been developed in order to assess software systems. Usually, they are used to measure software quality such as maintainability, reliability, error-proneness and etc. The most notable metric suites include Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) metrics, Abreu's Metrics for Object-Oriented Design (MOOD), and Bansiya and Davis' Quality Metrics for Object-Oriented Design (QMOOD). In our study, we tried to validate if the MOOD metrics can be useful to predict error-proneness of OO projects by finding correlations between the MOOD metrics and CK metrics that have been proved to be usefull as error-proneness indicator.
